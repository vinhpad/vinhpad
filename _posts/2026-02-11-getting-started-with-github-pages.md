# Getting Started with GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is an excellent platform for hosting static websites and blogs. Here's why I chose it:

## Benefits of GitHub Pages

1. **Free Hosting**: No cost for hosting your site
2. **Custom Domains**: You can use your own domain name
3. **Built-in Jekyll**: Automatic building of Jekyll sites
4. **Version Control**: All your content is in Git
5. **HTTPS**: Free SSL certificate included

## How It Works

GitHub Pages automatically builds and serves your Jekyll site whenever you push changes to your repository. It's that simple!

## Getting Your Own Blog

If you want to create your own blog on GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository named `username.github.io`
2. Add Jekyll files (like this blog)
3. Push to GitHub
4. Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io`

That's it! Happy blogging! 🎉
